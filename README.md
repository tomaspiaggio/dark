Dark is a sleek, Electron-based browser you can bend, hack and make your own, 100% React + TypeScript under the hood. Built on Chromium (so you still get Chrome DevTools and ecosystem compatibility), Dark makes browser customization as easy as editing a React component.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Fully Hackable**
  Everything in Dark is React + TypeScript. No C++ gatekeepers, if you know JS, you can extend or fork any part of the browser UI or behavior.

* **Chromium-Powered**
  Under the hood it's the same engine that powers Chrome, so all your favorite DevTools, extensions (via `session.loadExtension`), and web standards just work.

* **Modern UI**
  Built with React, Tailwind-style CSS and shadcn. Customize tabs, sidebars, themes, or even the entire address bar. The only rule is: "everything's Dark"

* **Cross-Platform**
  Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux, package once, ship everywhere.

* **Open & Supported**
  Unlike Arc (which went closed-source), Dark is 100% Apache 2.0-licensed and is 100% community-driven. We'll be here to merge your PRs and ship updates.

## üîí Open Source Pledge

**Dark will always remain 100% open source.**

We solemnly pledge that:

* **Forever Open**: Dark will never go closed-source, proprietary, or behind paywalls
* **Permissive License**: We commit to maintaining Apache 2.0 (or equivalent permissive licensing) in perpetuity
* **Community Ownership**: The core project will always be owned and governed by the community
* **No Vendor Lock-in**: You can fork, modify, redistribute, and even commercialize Dark without restriction

> *This isn't just a promise, it's our foundational principle. Unlike other browsers that started open and went commercial, Dark's architecture, governance, and licensing ensure it stays hackable forever.*

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomaspiaggio/dark.git
   cd dark
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in dev mode**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your custom browser will spin up with live-reload on React code changes.

4. **Build & Package**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üîß How to Hack

1. All UI lives under `src/renderer/` as React components.
2. Main-process logic (window management, IPC handlers) sits in `src/main/`.
3. Want to override the tab switcher, add a custom sidebar widget, or tweak your new-tab page? Just dive in, edit a `.tsx`, and your changes show up instantly in `npm start`.
